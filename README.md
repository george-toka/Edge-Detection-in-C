# Edge-Detection-in-C
Edge detection using Robert Cross and Prewitt Operators.

This project was developed as part of an Embedded Systems university course by a two-member team. The objective was to design and implement an edge detection algorithm while optimizing memory architecture for an embedded system.

Project Pipeline
Algorithm Implementation:

- Developed an edge detection algorithm using Robert Cross and Prewitt operators.
- Processed images in PPM format.
- Embedded System Simulation:

Implemented memory architecture using CodeWarrior IDE.
- Simulated and evaluated microprocessor performance using ARMulator under predefined specifications.
- Custom Memory Architecture:

Designed a memory hierarchy using SRAM caches and DRAM RAM.
- Analyzed microprocessor performance by varying read/write speeds across different memory banks.
